    <h1>Games I like and play</h1>
    <p>I  like  a  variety of  genres when it comes to games, In short some of my favourite games are Deus Ex,
      games from the Fallout Series, Fallout New Vegas, 
      GTA games, who does not like GTA?, Half Life, eh and some Call of Duty games i guess. </p>
    <h2>Deus Ex</h2>

    <p>Deus Ex is one of the best games I ever played. Despite being more than 20 years old,
      It is still considered a masterpiece. Do you know why my online-username is SmashTheState?
      It's because SMASHTHESTATE is a password to a computer terminal on the pedestal of the Staue Of Liberty
      in the first and one of the most iconic mission of Deus Ex.
      What I enjoyed most about Deus Ex was the <em>narrative and the dark environment and the fact that somehow it resembles the post 9/11 world we live in.</em>
      I think anyone with a decent attention span will enjoy Deus Ex.
      What? attention span? Yes this game is very deep and if you really want to enjoy it you have to have a decent attention span.
      If you don't, why are you even reading this go check your twitter for feeds.</p>
    <h2>Fallout Games</h2>
        <div>

	<p>Well, I like the OG Fallout games but for me they were too hard or I never seriously played them so I never actually completed any of those.
	  Couldn't play Fallout 3 because of some technical issues, What? Fallout 4? 76? Do you really think a guy who has
	  a website like this would ever play Fallout 4 let alone Fallout 76?
	  Fallout New Vegas is what I actually played. Just <em>imagine a game depicting the rise of civilization after a total nuclear annihilation and you,
	    the player decides the fate of this civilization.</em> Fallout New Vegas' environment is what I liked the most, The empty, dead, barren mojave desert </p>
	<h2>Grand Theft Auto</h2>
	<div>
	  <img src = "game_imgs/gtaiv.webp" title = "GTA IV" height = "300">

    <p> I had played GTA vice city on my cousin's computer i think more than 10 years ago but never completed it.
      Same goes for GTA San Andreas, actually I have both the games sitting on my hard disk but I never really played them seriously.
      So what have I played then? No not GTA V. My favourite GTA game (for now) is GTA IV. The game might have a bad pc port but
      it is a masterpiece in my opinion, whenever I have nothing to do on my computer I just load up GTA IV and go on a rampage.
      The thing i liked most about this game is not the physics, but the depiction of the <em> American dream</em>. Niko Bellic,
      The protagonist migrated to the US, New York  (Liberty city in game)  to be exact, to run away from the problems of a third world
      country. He later found out that America was no different..
