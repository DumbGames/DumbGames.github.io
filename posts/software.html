  <h1>Software I use</h1>
  <p>I mainly use Free/Libre software, inshort software that respects user's freedom.</p>
  <h2>Operating system</h2>
  <p>I use a distribution of GNU/Linux, <a href = "https://artixlinux.org/">Artix Linux </a>. Artix is based on Arch Linux which a very popular linux distro,
    So it is essentially arch but without systemD, an init system (first program to run as soon as you turn on your computer) that is kind of <a href = "https://www.linux.org/threads/what-is-systemd-and-the-controversy-regarding-it-solved.34208/page-2"> controversial</a>, but
    I don't have any problem with systemD I just use it to look cool on the internet <em>lol</em>.
    And for the desktop environment I use the aweosme window manager, I don't use DWM or Xmonad like the cool kids, but I think I'll make a switch in the future.</p>
  <h2>Web browser</h2>
  <p> I use <a href = "https://librewolf.net/"> Libre-Wolf</a>  as my web browser. It is a fork of Firefox and provides state of the art privacy features out of the box. I have also installed some extentions like <a href = "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/"> UBlock Origin </a> for blocking
    trackers and ads, <a href = "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/"> Decentraleyes </a> for blocking connection to major CDN services
    for privacy, <a href = "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/"> NoScript </a> for blocking javascript and
    <a href = "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/"> Dark Reader</a> for my eyes.</p>
  <h2>Game laucher</h2>
  <p>I use <a href = "https://lutris.net/"> lutris </a> for launching my games and keeping them organized.</p>

  <h2>Text editor</h2>
  <p> I use both <a href = "https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"> GNU Emacs</a> and <a href = "https://www.vim.org/"> vim </a>.
    I use Emacs for programming and other tasks where I have to keep staring at text for long and Vim for short text edits.
