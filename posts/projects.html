  <h1>Stuff I made</h1>
  <p>You will find all the games I made <a href = "https://dumbgame.itch.io/"> here </a> I didn't add that itch.io feature where
    you can integrate your games to your website so you don't have to visit itch.io because It will make the page load some javascript</p>
  <h2>You Ded</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/yd.png" title = "You Ded" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> You Ded was my first game, It doesn't look good and you can't even play it now because I messed up exporting it and lost it's source code,
    so yeah, it's gone, forever. The gameplay was something like this: You were a cube and you had to get to the exit which was a black box
    avoiding enemies who were static.
    Pretty basic I know but I was really happy after making it. And that's it for my first game.
  </p>
  <h2>Car goes vrooom vroom</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/cgv.png" title "Car goes vrooom vroom" height = "300">
  </div>

  <p>Yes I admit this game's title is kinda goofy but I was very proud of the game and it's name. It was my second game and
    for the first time I had created something which was fun? I think. It is a generic car game where you have to
    drive a car avoiding other cars, I didn't knew how to make those other cars move so I just placed them like they had crashed
    , Pretty "Smort" I know.
  </p>

  <h2>Freedoom</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/f.png" title = "Freedoom" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> This is pretty iconic because it was my first game I made in a game jam, an event where you have to create
    a game around a theme in a limited time  period. Well actually this was not my first time participating a game jam.
    I had joined the Godot Wild Jam in the past but wasn't able to create a game.
    This game is half finished with ALOT of bugs and gliches the reason for this was the heckin ExAmS.

  <h2>Car goes vrooom vroom in 3D</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/cgv2.png" title = "Car goes vrooom vroom in 3D" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> Ah yes the second installment to the "greatest" game in the world and my first 3D game.
    This was really just a clone of the first but in 3D and I took the car models from kenny, a place where you can get good assets for free
    (both as in freedom and beer). Controls were bad and there were game-breaking bugs but still I was proud of this game for some reason lol.
  </p>

    <h2>Opposite platformer</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/op.png" title = "Opposite platformer" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> This was I think my second game jam game and the fact that I hosted the game jam. It was a generic platformer, a player jumping, avoiding enemies
    and all that but opposite. This was really fun making, I wasn't able to get a good idea even though it was me who had decided the theme for the jam lol.
    Surprisingly a number of people joined my game jam and it got 8 submissions.
  </p>

    <h2>Dino</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/d.png" title = "Dino game" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> Nothing special to say about this one, this is a ""remaster"" of the offline chrome game except you can complete it but
    the thing is that you can never reach to the end because I messed up making the level.
  </p>

    <h2>Yeet The Axe</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/yta.png" title = "Yeet The Axe" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p>As you can guess by the name this game is about throwing axes. This is my second game jam, GoGodot Jam, and the first game jam game which I am still proud of to this day.
    I had really struggled making this game and I think it had turned out well. I used up all of my skills I had back then, tried new things.
    The only problem was that it didn't match the theme, believe or not I had tried my best to get a good idea around the theme "Energy Source" and my idea
    was that there was an energy source of monsters on earth which was spawning enemies and you, the player's task was to destroy it. Most of the people
    who played the game couldn't see the "energy source" because they continuosly spammed the Axe throw button which goes beyond the feild of view
    and destroys the energy source before the player reaching the area.

     <h2>You Ded 2</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/yd2.png" title = "Dino game" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> The second installment of my first game, The idea was pretty good but I did a VERY BIG mistake, play the game cause I can't describe it in words.
