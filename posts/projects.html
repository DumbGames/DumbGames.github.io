  <h1>Stuff I made</h1>
  <p>You will find all the games I made <a href = "https://dumbgame.itch.io/"> here </a> I didn't add that itch.io feature where
    you can integrate your games to your website so you don't have to visit itch.io because It will make the page load some javascript</p>
  <h2>You Ded</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/yd.png" title = "You Ded" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> You Ded was my first game, It doesn't look good and you can't even play it now because I messed up exporting it and lost it's source code,
    so yeah, it's gone, forever. The gameplay was something like this: You were a cube and you had to get to the exit which was a black box
    avoiding enemies who were static.
    Pretty basic I know but I was really happy after making it. And that's it for my first game.
  </p>
  <h2>Car goes vrooom vroom</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/cgv.png" title "Car goes vrooom vroom" height = "300">
  </div>

  <p>Yes I admit this game's title is kinda goofy but I was very proud of the game and it's name. It was my second game and
    for the first time I had created something which was fun? I think. It is a generic car game where you have to
    drive a car avoiding other cars, I didn't knew how to make those other cars move so I just placed them like they had crashed
    , Pretty "Smort" I know.
  </p>

  <h2>Freedoom</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/f.png" title = "Freedoom" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> This is pretty iconic because it was my first game I made in a game jam, an event where you have to create
    a game around a theme in a limited time  period. Well actually this was not my first time participating a game jam.
    I had joined the Godot Wild Jam in the past but wasn't able to create a game.
    This game is half finished with ALOT of bugs and gliches the reason for this was the heckin ExAmS.

  <h2>Car goes vrooom vroom in 3D</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/cgv2.png" title = "Car goes vrooom vroom in 3D" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> Ah yes the second installment to the "greatest" game in the world and my first 3D game.
    This was really just a clone of the first but in 3D and I took the car models from kenny, a place where you can get good assets for free
    (both as in freedom and beer). Controls were bad and there were game-breaking bugs but still I was proud of this game for some reason lol.
  </p>

    <h2>Opposite platformer</h2>
  <div>
    <img src = "game_imgs/op.png" title = "Opposite platformer" height = "300">
  </div>
  <p> This was I think my second game jam game and the fact that I hosted the game jam. It was a generic platformer, a player jumping, avoiding enemies
    and all that but opposite. This was really fun making, I wasn't able to get a good idea even though it was me who had decided the theme for the jam lol.
    Surprisingly a number of people joined my game jam and it got 8 submissions.
