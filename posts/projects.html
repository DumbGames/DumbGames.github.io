  <h1>Stuff I made</h1>
  <p>You will find all the games I made <a href = "https://dumbgame.itch.io/"> here </a> I didn't add that itch.io feature where
    you can integrate your games to your website so you don't have to visit itch.io because It will make the page loading slow.</p>
  <h2>You Ded</h2>
  <p> You Ded was my first game, It doesn't look good and you can't even play it now because I messed up exporting it and lost it's source code,
    so yeah, it's gone, forever. The gameplay was something like this: You were a cube and you had to get to the exit which was a black box
    avoiding enemies who were static.
    Pretty basic I know but I was really happy after making it. And that's it for my first game.
